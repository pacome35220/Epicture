# Epicture

A pretty bad rewrite of the Imgur application, with stolen code, I admit.

Write with [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [NativeBase](https://nativebase.io/).

## Before doing shit

> Obviously for a npm project.

```sh
$ npm install
```

## Run on device or emulator

Run the react-native server.

```sh
$ npm start
```

Then, if you trust your RAM, build and install this kinda app on your device/emulator.

```sh
$ npm run android
```
